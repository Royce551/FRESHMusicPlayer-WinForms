# Notes about contribution
This project automatically releasifies the project if you have the solution configuration set to "Release". This will fail if you do not have the package manager console open. 
(You shouldn't use this anyway in normal circumstances; to test with optimizations off, use the "ReleaseDebug" configuration.)
